Bit Shifting
------------

Ok, we know that numbers and letters are stored in binary. But how
do you convert from a number or a letter to binary? Perhaps you
forgot? Or you haven't taking "computer organization" yet as a
class?

No worries!

Here are a couple examples to help you get started. Be sure to
have your instructor step you through how they work.

This one shows, in detail, decoding one value.

.. literalinclude:: print_binary.py
    :linenos:
    :language: python

This takes it a step further by decoding a list/array of
values.

.. literalinclude:: print_bytes.py
    :linenos:
    :language: python
